if(fast == NULL) return head->next; // Edge Case handled when n = length of LL i.e. now n is first element of the LL. Example [1,2,3], n = 3. Here n is the length of the LL(Element which we want to remove is become the first element of the LL ) So fast become NULL as fast=fast->next n times so it become NULL at the end of the iteration and we can return head->next
